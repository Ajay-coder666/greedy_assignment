The following rules define a valid string:
Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".

27. Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. Find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train is kept waiting.
Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. Arrival and departure time 
can never be the same for a train but we can have arrival time of one train equal to departure time of the other. At any given instance of time, 
same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another train. In such cases, we need different platforms.
CODE:

28. In operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when the new page comes in. 
Whenever a new page is referred and is not present in memory, the page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with a newly needed page.
Given a sequence of pages in an array pages[] of length N and memory capacity C, find the number of page faults using Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm. 
Note:- Before solving this example revising the OS LRU cache mechanism is recommended.
